# from the Gnu C Library's locale directory, or a symbolic link that does the
# same thing. The "root" thing is a workaround because the Gnu C Library
# seems to ignore the presence of slashes in the locale environment variable,
# which is meant to indicate a file or directory name according to Posix.
